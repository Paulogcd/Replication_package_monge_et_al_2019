This is the repository of the replication package project done by CHAMBON Lionel, COMPÉRAT Étienne, and GUGELMO CAVALHEIRO DIAS Paulo, for the class "Computational Economics" taught by Florian Oswald in the Fall Semester 2024 in Sciences Po. 

# Useful Resources 

- https://github.com/JuliaCI/PkgTemplates.jl for the Package Template package. 

- https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20170381 for the article we are replicating. 

# Message of Florian : 

Reminder about minimum requirements for term project:
1. published on github as a julia package. That is, it has to be a working module.
2. You can take quite a lot of inspiration from this setup: https://github.com/JuliaLang/Example.jl
3. However, it’s easier (and automatic) to use PkgTemplates.jl to help you set up all the stuff correctly on github. That said, I will not force any framework on to you, your choice.
4. You need to have a README and a package documentation. Look at Example.jl above.
5. your package needs to contain a function called run(). Executing it will produce all the output you want to show.
6. You will earn points for the following things. total is 20 points as usual. Points in brackets.
7. github repo exists and it contains a proper julia package (see Example.jl) (2)
8. README exists and is informative (require much more than Example.jl) (2)
9. docs exist (2)
10. unit tests exist (and run) (2)
11. package installs on my machine (you setup Project.toml correctly) (3)
12. run() runs (3)
13. output corresponds to paper, if not why not (2)
14. quality of your code - I can understand what’s going on just looking at the code (2)
15. ambitiousness of the project (2)
